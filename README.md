# Text-Classification

The goal of the project was to learn text mining techniques. The development process was divided into three
steps. First, a baseline text classification system was developed and it was applied to a new dataset. Then,
the baseline system was modified and the performance of the modified system was compared with the
baseline system.

Dataset Description:
The datasets used for the project are: SMS Spam collection dataset and BBCSport dataset.
▪ SMS Spam collection dataset
The dataset contains a set of 5,572 SMS tagged messages. Each message is composed of two columns:
text contains the raw text and label contains the label (ham or spam).
▪ BBCSport dataset
The dataset contains 737 documents from the BBC Sport website corresponding to sports news
articles in five topical areas from 2004-2005. The documents were pre-labeled as having tennis,
rugby, football, cricket, athletics content.
